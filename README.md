#Team 3 - nsided die problem
- David Watkins (djw2146)
- David RC
- Shardendu

##Progress since class 1 (10/26)
- We all got our certification to use the Maker Space
- We generated a script to produce n-sided die
- We realized that the proportion of the angle that defines the length of a side can be the center of a cirlce that circumscribes an n-sided polygonal barrel die. Therefore for a six sided die the angles of the triangles form from the center point to two adjacent vertices could be: 2*pi * 1/63, 2*pi * 2/63, 2*pi * 4/63, etc.
- We looked at bullet for attempting to simulate the rolling of die but we haven't had any progress yet.
